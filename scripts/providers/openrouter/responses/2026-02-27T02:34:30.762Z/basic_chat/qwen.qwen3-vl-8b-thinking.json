Let me count: \"Doing great, thanks for asking!\" That's five words. Wait, \"Doing\" is one, \"great\" is two, \"thanks\" is three, \"for\" is four, \"asking\" is five. Yes, that works.\n\nAlso, the user said \"Hello World!\" earlier, which might mean they're in a playful mood. Keeping it light and cheerful would fit. I should avoid any technical jargon. Just make sure it's concise and meets the word count. Double-checking: \"Doing great, thanks for asking!\" Yep, five words. Perfect.\n",
