That makes me think they might be testing my ability to follow precise instructions or just want a fun, lighthearted exchange. \n\nI should keep it warm and positive since they seem friendly. \"I'm excellent, thank you for asking!\" is perfect—it's 5 words, polite, and matches their playful tone. \n\nWait, let me count: \"I'm\" (1), \"excellent\" (2), \"thank\" (3), \"you\" (4), \"asking!\" (5). Yep, exactly 5. And the exclamation point adds energy without breaking the count. \n\n...Did they expect me to be literal about \"I'm doing\"? Like, as if I have feelings? Nah, they're probably just being casual. Better not overcomplicate it. Keep it simple and cheerful.\n",
