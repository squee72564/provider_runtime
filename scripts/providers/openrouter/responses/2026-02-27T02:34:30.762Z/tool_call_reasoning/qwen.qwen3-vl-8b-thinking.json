Since the user might be more familiar with Fahrenheit, I'll mention both values but highlight the Fahrenheit temperature. I should also check if there's any additional info, but the tool response only has temperature. Let me make sure to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit correctly. Wait, 16°C is indeed 60°F, so that's correct.\n\nI'll structure the response: start with the city, mention the temperature in both scales, and maybe add a brief note about the weather being mild. Keep it friendly and concise. Let me check for any errors in the numbers. Yep, looks good. Alright, time to write the response.\n",
