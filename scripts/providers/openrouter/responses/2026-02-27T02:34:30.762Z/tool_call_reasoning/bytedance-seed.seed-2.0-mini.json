First, start by answering the question, mention the current temperature in both units since that's what the tool provided. Let me make it natural. Something like \"The current weather in San Francisco is 16°C (60°F).\" Wait, wait, the tool had a typo? Farhenheit should be Fahrenheit, but the response has that, but I can just correct that gently? No, just report the data as given clearly.
