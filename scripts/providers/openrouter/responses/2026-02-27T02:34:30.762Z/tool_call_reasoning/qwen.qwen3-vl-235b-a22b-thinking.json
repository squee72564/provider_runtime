I should format it in a way that's easy to read. Maybe start with \"The current weather in San Francisco is 16°C (60°F).\" That covers both units. Let me check if there's any other data, but it seems like just the temperatures. No mention of conditions like sunny or cloudy, so I'll stick to the temperatures provided. Alright, that should answer the user's question accurately.\n",
